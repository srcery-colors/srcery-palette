Srcery palette
==============

Srcery palette, hopefully we can move more and more projects over to reading
from this repo. Not quite there yet though.

You can clone and use the JSON here for whatever, or you can use the npm
package, that simply exports the palette to js object.

## Package

```sh
npm i @srcery-colors/srcery-palette
```
